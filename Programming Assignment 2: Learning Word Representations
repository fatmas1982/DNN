Train a model for 10 epochs with a 50 dimensional embedding space, 200 dimensional hidden layer, a learning rate of 100.0 and default setting of all other hyperparameters. What do you observe ? [3 points]

Cross Entropy on the validation set fluctuates around a large value.
Correct 

Cross Entropy on the training set fluctuates wildly and eventually diverges.
Un-selected is correct 

Cross Entropy on the training set fluctuates around a large value.
Correct 

Cross Entropy on the training set decreases smoothly but fluctuates around a large value on the validation set.
Un-selected is correct

11. 
In the model trained in Question 10, why is the word 'percent' close to 'dr.' even though they have very different contexts and are not expected to be close in word embedding space? [2 points]

We trained the model with too large a learning rate.

Both words occur too frequently.
This should not be selected 

Both words occur very rarely, so their embedding weights get updated very few times and remain close to their initialization.

The model is not capable of separating them in embedding space, even if it got a much larger training set.

12. 
In the model trained in Question 10, why is 'he' close to 'she' even though they refer to completely different genders? [2 points]

Both words occur very rarely, so their embedding weights get updated very few times and remain close to their initialization.

They differ by only one letter.
This should not be selected 

They often occur close by in sentences.

The model does not care about gender. It puts them close because if 'he' occurs in a 4-gram, it is very likely that substituting it by 'she' will also make a sensible 4-gram.

13. 
In conclusion, what kind of words does the model put close to each other in embedding space. Choose the most appropriate answer. [3 points]

Words that occur close to each other (within three words to the left or right) in many sentences.

Words that belong to similar topics. A topic is a semantic categorization (like 'sports', 'art', 'business', 'computers' etc).
This should not be selected 

Words that are such that if one word occurs in a 4-gram replacing it with the other also creates a sensible 4-gram.

Words that occur close in an alphabetical sort.
