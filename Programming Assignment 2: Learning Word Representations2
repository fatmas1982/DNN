1. 
We are now ready to start using neural nets for solving real problems!

In this assignment we will design a neural net language model. The model will learn to predict the next word given the previous three words. The network looks like this:


To get started, download any one of the following archives.

Or

assignment2.zip

Or each file individually:

train.m

The starter code implements a basic framework for training neural nets with mini-batch gradient descent. Your job is to write code to complete the implementation of forward and back propagation. See the README file for a description of the dataset, starter code and how to run it.

This sample_output shows you what output to expect once everything is implemented correctly.

Once you have implemented the required code and have the model running, answer the following questions.

11. 
In the model trained in Question 10, why is the word 'percent' close to 'dr.' even though they have very different contexts and are not expected to be close in word embedding space? [2 points]

Both words occur too frequently.

We trained the model with too large a learning rate.

The model is not capable of separating them in embedding space, even if it got a much larger training set.
This should not be selected 

Both words occur very rarely, so their embedding weights get updated very few times and remain close to their initialization.

Correct
2 / 2 points
12. 
In the model trained in Question 10, why is 'he' close to 'she' even though they refer to completely different genders? [2 points]

The model does not care about gender. It puts them close because if 'he' occurs in a 4-gram, it is very likely that substituting it by 'she' will also make a sensible 4-gram.
Correct 

Both words occur very rarely, so their embedding weights get updated very few times and remain close to their initialization.

They differ by only one letter.

They often occur close by in sentences.

13. 
In conclusion, what kind of words does the model put close to each other in embedding space. Choose the most appropriate answer. [3 points]

Words that occur close to each other (within three words to the left or right) in many sentences.
This should not be selected 

Words that have a lot of letters in common.

Words that are such that if one word occurs in a 4-gram replacing it with the other also creates a sensible 4-gram.

Words that belong to similar topics. A topic is a semantic categorization (like 'sports', 'art', 'business', 'computers' etc).
